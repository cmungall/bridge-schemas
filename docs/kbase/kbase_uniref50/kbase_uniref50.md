# kbase_uniref50 

UniRef50 clustered protein sequences at 50% sequence identity threshold. Part of the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) providing highly compressed clustered sets of sequences from UniProt.
DATABASE STATISTICS: - Clusters and entities - Cross-references to UniProt entries
CLUSTERING: UniRef50 clusters sequences at 50% identity and 80% coverage thresholds, providing maximum redundancy reduction while preserving functional diversity. Useful for fast homology searches and reduced database sizes.
USAGE: Use for broad functional annotation or when searching large sequence sets where redundancy reduction is important.
