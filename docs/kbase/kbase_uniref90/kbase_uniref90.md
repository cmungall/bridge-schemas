# kbase_uniref90 

UniRef90 clustered protein sequences at 90% sequence identity threshold. Part of the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) providing clustered sets of sequences from UniProt and selected UniParc records.
DATABASE STATISTICS: - 100,000+ clusters - 100,000+ entities - Cross-references to UniProt entries
CLUSTERING: UniRef90 clusters sequences at 90% identity and 80% coverage thresholds, providing a balance between redundancy reduction and functional diversity.
USAGE: Join with kbase_ke_pangenome or other genome databases to find protein cluster memberships and functional annotations.
