title: UniRef50 Sequence Clusters
description: >-
  UniRef50 clustered protein sequences at 50% sequence identity threshold.
  Part of the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) providing highly compressed
  clustered sets of sequences from UniProt.

  DATABASE STATISTICS:
  - Clusters and entities
  - Cross-references to UniProt entries

  CLUSTERING:
  UniRef50 clusters sequences at 50% identity and 80% coverage thresholds,
  providing maximum redundancy reduction while preserving functional diversity.
  Useful for fast homology searches and reduced database sizes.

  USAGE:
  Use for broad functional annotation or when searching large sequence sets
  where redundancy reduction is important.
