title: UniRef90 Sequence Clusters
description: >-
  UniRef90 clustered protein sequences at 90% sequence identity threshold.
  Part of the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) providing clustered sets
  of sequences from UniProt and selected UniParc records.

  DATABASE STATISTICS:
  - 100,000+ clusters
  - 100,000+ entities
  - Cross-references to UniProt entries

  CLUSTERING:
  UniRef90 clusters sequences at 90% identity and 80% coverage thresholds,
  providing a balance between redundancy reduction and functional diversity.

  USAGE:
  Join with kbase_ke_pangenome or other genome databases to find protein
  cluster memberships and functional annotations.
