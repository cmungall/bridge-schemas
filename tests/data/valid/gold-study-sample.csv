This project aims to use coal seams in the Surat Basin as in situ bioreactors using indigenous microorganisms grown under optimized conditions to replenish methane drained during CSG production. The Surat Basin has significant biogenic methane resources and preliminary trials suggest that it also has significant bioreactor potential.",109244.0,nan,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,No,No,Yes,No,
