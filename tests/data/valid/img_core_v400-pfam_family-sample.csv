pfam00001,7tm_1,7 transmembrane receptor (rhodopsin family),260,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Family,"This family contains, amongst other G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs), members of the opsin family, which have been considered to be typical members of the rhodopsin superfamily. They share several motifs, mainly the seven transmembrane helices, GCPRs of the rhodopsin superfamily. All opsins bind a chromophore, such as 11-cis-retinal. The function of most opsins other than the photoisomerases is split into two steps: light absorption and G-protein activation. Photoisomerases, on the other hand, are not coupled to G-proteins - they are thought to generate and supply the chromophore that is used by visual opsins [1].",CHANGED,
pfam00002,7tm_2,7 transmembrane receptor (Secretin family),250,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Family,"This family is known as Family B, the secretin-receptor family or family 2 of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs). They have been described in many animal species, but not in plants, fungi or prokaryotes. Three distinct sub-families are recognised. Subfamily B1 contains classical hormone receptors, such as receptors for secretin and glucagon, that are all involved in cAMP-mediated signalling pathways. Subfamily B2 contains receptors with long extracellular N-termini, such as the leukocyte cell-surface antigen CD97 (Swiss:P48960); calcium-independent receptors for latrotoxin (such as Swiss:O94910), and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitors (such as Swiss:O14514) amongst others. Subfamily B3 includes Methuselah and other Drosophila proteins (e.g. Swiss:P83119). Other than the typical seven-transmembrane region, characteristic structural features include an amino-terminal extracellular domain involved in ligand binding, and an intracellular loop (IC3) required for specific G-protein coupling [1].",CHANGED,
pfam00003,7tm_3,7 transmembrane sweet-taste receptor of 3 GCPR,251,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Domain,"This is a domain of seven transmembrane regions that forms the C-terminus of some subclass 3 G-coupled-protein receptors. It is often associated with a downstream cysteine-rich linker domain, NCD3G Pfam:PF07562, which is the human sweet-taste receptor, and the N-terminal domain, ANF_receptor Pfam:PF01094. The seven TM regions assemble in such a way as to produce a docking pocket into which such molecules as cyclamate and lactisole have been found to bind and consequently confer the taste of sweetness [1].",CHANGED,
pfam00004,AAA,ATPase family associated with various cellular activities (AAA),131,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Domain,"AAA family proteins often perform chaperone-like functions that assist in the assembly, operation, or disassembly of protein complexes [2].",CHANGED,
pfam00005,ABC_tran,ABC transporter,137,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Domain,"ABC transporters for a large family of proteins responsible for translocation of a variety of compounds across biological membranes.  ABC transporters are the largest family of proteins in many completely sequenced bacteria. ABC transporters are composed of two copies of this domain and two copies of a transmembrane domain Pfam:PF00664. These four domains may belong to a single polypeptide as in Swiss:P13569, or belong in different polypeptide chains.",CHANGED,
pfam00006,ATP-synt_ab,"ATP synthase alpha/beta family, nucleotide-binding domain",213,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Domain,"This entry includes the ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits, the ATP synthase associated with flagella and the termination factor Rho.",CHANGED,
pfam00007,Cys_knot,Cystine-knot domain,105,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Domain,The family comprises glycoprotein hormones and the C-terminal domain of various extracellular proteins.  It is believed to be involved in disulfide-linked dimerisation.,CHANGED,
pfam00008,EGF,EGF-like domain,32,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Domain,"There is no clear separation between noise and signal. Pfam:PF00053 is very similar, but has 8 instead of 6 conserved cysteines. Includes some cytokine receptors. The EGF domain misses the N-terminus regions of the Ca2+ binding EGF domains (this is the main reason of discrepancy between swiss-prot domain start/end and Pfam).  The family is hard to model due to many similar but  different sub-types of EGF domains. Pfam certainly misses a number of EGF domains. ",CHANGED,
pfam00009,GTP_EFTU,Elongation factor Tu GTP binding domain,188,,2024-09-10 17:31:22.000,,Domain,"This domain contains a P-loop motif, also found in several other families such as Pfam:PF00071, Pfam:PF00025 and Pfam:PF00063. Elongation factor Tu consists of three structural domains, this plus two C-terminal beta barrel domains.",CHANGED,
