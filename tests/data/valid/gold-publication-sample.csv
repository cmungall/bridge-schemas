Gammaherpesviruses are of interest because of their long-term infection of lymphoid cells and their potential to cause cancer. Here, we report the characterization of a novel bat herpesvirus isolated from a big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in Canada. The genome of the virus, tentatively named Eptesicus fuscus herpesvirus (EfHV), is 166,748 base pairs. Phylogenetically EfHV is a member of Gammaherpesvirinae, in which it belongs to the Genus Rhadinovirus and is closely related to other bat Gammaherpesviruses. In contrast to other known Gammaherpesviruses, the EfHV genome contains coding sequences similar to those of class I and II host major histocompatibility antigens. The virus is capable of infecting and replicating in human, monkey, cat and pig cell lines. Although we detected EfHV in 20 of 28 big brown bats tested, these bats lacked neutralizing antibodies against the virus.","Departments of Veterinary Microbiology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.","Isolation, characterization and prevalence of a novel Gammaherpesvirus in Eptesicus fuscus, the North American big brown bat.",,

We developed four new canSNP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on the genome sequence information. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:  may persist locally over long time periods without causing outbreaks. The existence of genetically highly similar strain-pairs isolated the same year in the same area from different hosts supports a hypothesis of local expansion of clones during outbreaks. Close relationship (two SNPs) was found between one strain isolated 1961 in northeast Bulgaria and one strain isolated 5 years before in USSR. Historical data coinciding with the actual time point describe the introduction of water rats from USSR into the Bulgarian outbreak area, which may explain the close genetic relationship and the origin of the outbreak.

After transmission by blood-sucking arthropods they colonize the erythrocytes of mammalian hosts causing acute and chronic infectious diseases. Although the pathogen-host interaction is well understood, little is known about the evolutionary origin of the infection strategy manifested by Bartonella species. Here we analyzed six genomes of Bartonella apis, a honey bee gut symbiont that to date represents the closest relative of pathogenic Bartonella species. Comparative genomics revealed that B. apis encodes a large set of vertically inherited genes for amino acid and cofactor biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. Most pathogenic bartonellae have lost these ancestral functions, but acquired specific virulence factors and expanded a vertically inherited gene family for harvesting cofactors from the blood. However, the deeply rooted pathogen Bartonella tamiae has retained many of the ancestral genome characteristics reflecting an evolutionary intermediate state toward a host-restricted intraerythrocytic lifestyle. Our findings suggest that the ancestor of the pathogen Bartonella was a gut symbiont of insects and that the adaptation to blood-feeding insects facilitated colonization of the mammalian bloodstream. This study highlights the importance of comparative genomics among pathogens and non-pathogenic relatives to understand disease emergence within an evolutionary-ecological framework.","Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",Genomic changes associated with the evolutionary transition of an insect gut symbiont into a blood-borne pathogen.,,

In this work we isolated and characterized several bacterial isolates from compost, a substrate rich in microbial diversity. The isolates were obtained from selective culture medium containing n-hexadecane, aiming to recover alkane-degraders. Six isolates identified as Gordonia by MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA sequencing had the ability to degrade n-hexadecane in three days. Two isolates were selected for genomic and functional characterization, Gordonia paraffinivorans (MTZ052) and Gordonia sihwensis (MTZ096). The CG-MS results showed distinct n-hexadecane degradation rates for MTZ052 and MTZ096 (86% and 100% respectively). The genome sequence showed that MTZ052 encodes only one alkane degrading gene cluster, the CYP153 system, while MTZ096 harbors both the Alkane Hydroxylase (AH) and the CYP153 systems. qPCR showed that both gene clusters are induced by the presence of n-hexadecane in the growth medium, suggesting that G. paraffinivorans and G. sihwensis use these systems for degradation. Altogether, our results indicate that these Gordonia isolates have a good potential for biotransformation of hydrocarbons.","Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.",Characterization of novel hydrocarbon-degrading Gordonia paraffinivorans and Gordonia sihwensis strains isolated from composting.,,

An atypical C. ulcerans strain, W25, was recently isolated from a case of necrotizing lymphadenitis in a wild boar. In this study, we have analysed the genome sequence of this strain and compared the phenotypic and virulence properties with other corynebacterial pathogens. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that strain W25 belongs to a novel species along with PO100/5 and KL1196. The latter strains were isolated from a pig and a roe deer, respectively; hence, this species appears to be associated to animals. The isolate W25 is likely a non-toxigenic tox gene bearing strain and may have compromised abilities to adhere to pharyngeal and laryngeal epithelial cells due to potential loss of the gene functions in spaBC and spaDEF pilus gene clusters. A number of corynebacterial virulence genes are present including pld encoding phospholipase D. Therefore, this strain may be able to cause severe invasive infections in animals and zoonotic infections in humans.","Professur für Mikrobiologie, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.",Phylogenomic characterisation of a novel corynebacterial species pathogenic to animals.,,
